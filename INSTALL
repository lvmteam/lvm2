Installation
============

1) Generate custom makefiles.

   Run the 'configure' script from the top directory.

   On system with udevd use: --enable-udev_sync

   To build with dmeventd: --enable-cmdlib --enable-dmeventd

   For DBus support: --enable-dbus-service --enable-notify-dbus

   For lvmpolld usage: --enable-lvmpolld

   For lvmlockd support: --enable-lvmlockd-sanlock --enable-lvmlockd-dlm --enable-lvmlockd-dlmcontrol

   Use ./configure --help to see other options.

2) Build and install.

   Run 'make' from the top directory to build everything you configured.
   Run 'make install' to build and install everything you configured.

   If you only want the device-mapper libraries and tools use
   'make device-mapper' or 'make install_device-mapper'.

3) If using LVM2, create a configuration file.

   The tools will work fine without a configuration file being
   present, but you ought to review the example file in conf/example.conf.

Please also refer to the WHATS_NEW file and the manual pages for the
individual commands.
