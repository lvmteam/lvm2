.SH NAME
lvmlockd \(em LVM locking daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
LVM commands use lvmlockd to coordinate access to shared storage.
.br
When LVM is used on devices shared by multiple hosts, locks will:

.IP \[bu] 2
coordinate reading and writing of LVM metadata
.IP \[bu] 2
validate caching of LVM metadata
.IP \[bu] 2
prevent concurrent activation of logical volumes

.P

lvmlockd uses an external lock manager to perform basic locking.
.br
Lock manager (lock type) options are:

.IP \[bu] 2
sanlock: places locks on disk within LVM storage.
.IP \[bu] 2
dlm: uses network communication and a cluster manager.

.P

.SH USAGE

.SS Initial set up

Using LVM with lvmlockd for the first time includes some one-time set up
steps:

.SS 1. choose a lock manager

.I dlm
.br
If dlm (or corosync) are already being used by other cluster
software, then select dlm.  dlm uses corosync which requires additional
configuration beyond the scope of this document.  See corosync and dlm
documentation for instructions on configuration, setup and usage.

.I sanlock
.br
Choose sanlock if dlm/corosync are not otherwise required.
sanlock does not depend on any clustering software or configuration.

.SS 2. configure hosts to use lvmlockd

On all hosts running lvmlockd, configure lvm.conf:
.nf
locking_type = 1
use_lvmlockd = 1
use_lvmetad = 1
.fi

.I sanlock
.br
Assign each host a unique host_id in the range 1-2000 by setting
.br
/etc/lvm/lvmlocal.conf local/host_id = <num>

.SS 3. start lvmlockd

Use a service/init file if available, or just run "lvmlockd".

.SS 4. start lock manager

.I sanlock
.br
systemctl start wdmd sanlock

.I dlm
.br
Follow external clustering documentation when applicable, otherwise:
.br
systemctl start corosync dlm

.SS 5. create VGs on shared devices

vgcreate --shared <vg_name> <devices>

The vgcreate --shared option sets the VG lock type to sanlock or dlm
depending on which lock manager is running.  LVM commands will perform
locking for the VG using lvmlockd.

.SS 6. start VGs on all hosts

vgchange --lock-start

lvmlockd requires shared VGs to be "started" before they are used.  This
is a lock manager operation to start/join the VG lockspace, and it may
take some time.  Until the start completes, locks for the VG are not
available.  LVM commands are allowed to read the VG while start is in
progress.  (A service/init file can be used to start VGs.)

.SS 7. create and activate LVs

Standard lvcreate and lvchange commands are used to create and activate
LVs in a lockd VG.

An LV activated exclusively on one host cannot be activated on another.
When multiple hosts need to use the same LV concurrently, the LV can be
activated with a shared lock (see lvchange options -aey vs -asy.)
(Shared locks are disallowed for certain LV types that cannot be used from
multiple hosts.)


.SS Normal start up and shut down

After initial set up, start up and shut down include the following general
steps.  They can be performed manually or using the system init/service
manager.

.IP \[bu] 2
start lvmetad
.IP \[bu] 2
start lvmlockd
.IP \[bu] 2
start lock manager
.IP \[bu] 2
vgchange --lock-start
.IP \[bu] 2
activate LVs in shared VGs

.P

The shut down sequence is the reverse:

.IP \[bu] 2
deactivate LVs in shared VGs
.IP \[bu] 2
vgchange --lock-stop
.IP \[bu] 2
stop lock manager
.IP \[bu] 2
stop lvmlockd
.IP \[bu] 2
stop lvmetad

.P

.SH TOPICS

.SS locking terms

The following terms are used to distinguish VGs that require locking from
those that do not.

.I "lockd VG"

A "lockd VG" is a shared VG that has a "lock type" of dlm or sanlock.
Using it requires lvmlockd.  These VGs exist on shared storage that is
visible to multiple hosts.  LVM commands use lvmlockd to perform locking
for these VGs when they are used.

If the lock manager for a lock type is not available (e.g. not started or
failed), lvmlockd is not able to acquire locks from it, and LVM commands
are unable to fully use VGs with the given lock type.  Commands generally
allow reading VGs in this condition, but changes and activation are not
allowed.  Maintaining a properly running lock manager can require
background not covered here.

.I "local VG"

A "local VG" is meant to be used by a single host.  It has no lock type or
lock type "none".  LVM commands and lvmlockd do not perform locking for
these VGs.  A local VG typically exists on local (non-shared) devices and
cannot be used concurrently from different hosts.

If a local VG does exist on shared devices, it should be owned by a single
host by having its system ID set, see
.BR lvmsystemid (7).
Only the host with a matching system ID can use the local VG.  A VG
with no lock type and no system ID should be excluded from all but one
host using lvm.conf filters.  Without any of these protections, a local VG
on shared devices can be easily damaged or destroyed.

.I "clvm VG"

A "clvm VG" is a VG on shared storage (like a lockd VG) that requires
clvmd for clustering.  See below for converting a clvm VG to a lockd VG.


.SS lockd VGs from hosts not using lvmlockd

Only hosts that will use lockd VGs should be configured to run lvmlockd.
However, devices with lockd VGs may be visible from hosts not using
lvmlockd.  From a host not using lvmlockd, visible lockd VGs are ignored
in the same way as foreign VGs, i.e. those with a foreign system ID, see
.BR lvmsystemid (7).

The --shared option displays lockd VGs on a host not using lvmlockd, like
the --foreign option does for foreign VGs.


.SS vgcreate differences

Forms of the vgcreate command:

.B vgcreate <vg_name> <devices>

.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a local VG with the local system ID when neither lvmlockd nor clvm are configured.
.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a local VG with the local system ID when lvmlockd is configured.
.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a clvm VG when clvm is configured.

.P

.B vgcreate --shared <vg_name> <devices>
.IP \[bu] 2
Requires lvmlockd to be configured (use_lvmlockd=1).
.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a lockd VG with lock type sanlock|dlm depending on which is running.
.IP \[bu] 2
LVM commands request locks from lvmlockd to use the VG.
.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd obtains locks from the selected lock manager.

.P

.B vgcreate -c|--clustered y <vg_name> <devices>
.IP \[bu] 2
Requires clvm to be configured (locking_type=3).
.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a clvm VG with the "clustered" flag.
.IP \[bu] 2
LVM commands request locks from clvmd to use the VG.

.P

.SS using lockd VGs

When use_lvmlockd is first enabled, and before the first lockd VG is
created, no global lock will exist, and LVM commands will try and fail to
acquire it.  LVM commands will report a warning until the first lockd VG
is created which will create the global lock.  Before the global lock
exists, VGs can still be read, but commands that require the global lock
exclusively will fail.

When a new lockd VG is created, its lockspace is automatically started on
the host that creates the VG.  Other hosts will need to run 'vgchange
--lock-start' to start the new VG before they can use it.

From the 'vgs' command, lockd VGs are indicated by "s" (for shared) in the
sixth attr field.  The specific lock type and lock args for a lockd VG can
be displayed with 'vgs -o+locktype,lockargs'.


.SS starting and stopping VGs

Starting a lockd VG (vgchange --lock-start) causes the lock manager to
start or join the lockspace for the VG.  This makes locks for the VG
accessible to the host.  Stopping the VG leaves the lockspace and makes
locks for the VG inaccessible to the host.

Lockspaces should be started as early as possible because starting
(joining) a lockspace can take a long time (potentially minutes after a
host failure when using sanlock.)  A VG can be started after all the
following are true:

.nf
- lvmlockd is running
- lock manager is running
- VG is visible to the system
.fi

All lockd VGs can be started/stopped using:
.br
vgchange --lock-start
.br
vgchange --lock-stop


Individual VGs can be started/stopped using:
.br
vgchange --lock-start <vg_name> ...
.br
vgchange --lock-stop <vg_name> ...

To make vgchange not wait for start to complete:
.br
vgchange --lock-start --lock-opt nowait
.br
vgchange --lock-start --lock-opt nowait <vg_name>

To stop all lockspaces and wait for all to complete:
.br
lvmlockctl --stop-lockspaces --wait

To start only selected lockd VGs, use the lvm.conf
activation/lock_start_list.  When defined, only VG names in this list are
started by vgchange.  If the list is not defined (the default), all
visible lockd VGs are started.  To start only "vg1", use the following
lvm.conf configuration:

.nf
activation {
    lock_start_list = [ "vg1" ]
    ...
}
.fi


.SS automatic starting and automatic activation

Scripts or programs on a host that automatically start VGs will use the
"auto" option to indicate that the command is being run automatically by
the system:

vgchange --lock-start --lock-opt auto [vg_name ...]

Without any additional configuration, including the "auto" option has no
effect; all VGs are started unless restricted by lock_start_list.

However, when the lvm.conf activation/auto_lock_start_list is defined, the
auto start command performs an additional filtering phase to all VGs being
started, testing each VG name against the auto_lock_start_list.  The
auto_lock_start_list defines lockd VGs that will be started by the auto
start command.  Visible lockd VGs not included in the list are ignored by
the auto start command.  If the list is undefined, all VG names pass this
filter.  (The lock_start_list is also still used to filter all VGs.)

The auto_lock_start_list allows a user to select certain lockd VGs that
should be automatically started by the system (or indirectly, those that
should not).

To use auto activation of lockd LVs (see auto_activation_volume_list),
auto starting of the corresponding lockd VGs is necessary.


.SS locking activity

To optimize the use of LVM with lvmlockd, consider the three kinds of
locks in lvmlockd and when they are used:

.I GL lock

The global lock (GL lock) is associated with global information, which is
information not isolated to a single VG.  This includes:

- The global VG namespace.
.br
- The set of orphan PVs and unused devices.
.br
- The properties of orphan PVs, e.g. PV size.

The global lock is used in shared mode by commands that read this
information, or in exclusive mode by commands that change it.

The command 'vgs' acquires the global lock in shared mode because it
reports the list of all VG names.

The vgcreate command acquires the global lock in exclusive mode because it
creates a new VG name, and it takes a PV from the list of unused PVs.

When an LVM command is given a tag argument, or uses select, it must read
all VGs to match the tag or selection, which causes the global lock to be
acquired.  To avoid use of the global lock, avoid using tags and select,
and specify VG name arguments.

When use_lvmlockd is enabled, LVM commands attempt to acquire the global
lock even if no lockd VGs exist.  For this reason, lvmlockd should not be
enabled unless lockd VGs will be used.

.I VG lock

A VG lock is associated with each VG.  The VG lock is acquired in shared
mode to read the VG and in exclusive mode to change the VG (modify the VG
metadata).  This lock serializes modifications to a VG with all other LVM
commands accessing the VG from all hosts.

The command 'vgs' will not only acquire the GL lock to read the list of
all VG names, but will acquire the VG lock for each VG prior to reading
it.

The command 'vgs <vg_name>' does not acquire the GL lock (it does not need
the list of all VG names), but will acquire the VG lock on each VG name
argument.

.I LV lock

An LV lock is acquired before the LV is activated, and is released after
the LV is deactivated.  If the LV lock cannot be acquired, the LV is not
activated.  LV locks are persistent and remain in place after the
activation command is done.  GL and VG locks are transient, and are held
only while an LVM command is running.

.I retries

If a request for a GL or VG lock fails due to a lock conflict with another
host, lvmlockd automatically retries for a short time before returning a
failure to the LVM command.  The LVM command will then retry the entire
lock request a number of times specified by global/lvmlockd_lock_retries
before failing.  If a request for an LV lock fails due to a lock conflict,
the command fails immediately.


.SS sanlock global lock

There are some special cases related to the global lock in sanlock VGs.

The global lock exists in one of the sanlock VGs.  The first sanlock VG
created will contain the global lock.  Subsequent sanlock VGs will each
contain disabled global locks that can be enabled later if necessary.

The VG containing the global lock must be visible to all hosts using
sanlock VGs.  This can be a reason to create a small sanlock VG, visible
to all hosts, and dedicated to just holding the global lock.  While not
required, this strategy can help to avoid difficulty in the future if VGs
are moved or removed.

The vgcreate command typically acquires the global lock, but in the case
of the first sanlock VG, there will be no global lock to acquire until the
initial vgcreate is complete.  So, creating the first sanlock VG is a
special case that skips the global lock.

vgcreate for a sanlock VG determines it is the first one to exist if no
other sanlock VGs are visible.  It is possible that other sanlock VGs do
exist but are not visible or started on the host running vgcreate.  This
raises the possibility of more than one global lock existing.  If this
happens, commands will warn of the condition, and it should be manually
corrected.

If the situation arises where more than one sanlock VG contains a global
lock, the global lock should be manually disabled in all but one of them
with the command:

lvmlockctl --gl-disable <vg_name>

(The one VG with the global lock enabled must be visible to all hosts.)

An opposite problem can occur if the VG holding the global lock is
removed.  In this case, no global lock will exist following the vgremove,
and subsequent LVM commands will fail to acquire it.  In this case, the
global lock needs to be manually enabled in one of the remaining sanlock
VGs with the command:

lvmlockctl --gl-enable <vg_name>

A small sanlock VG dedicated to holding the global lock can avoid the case
where the GL lock must be manually enabled after a vgremove.


.SS changing a local VG to a lockd VG

All LVs must be inactive to change the lock type.

lvmlockd must be configured and running as described in USAGE.

Change a local VG to a lockd VG with the command:
.br
vgchange \-\-lock\-type sanlock|dlm <vg_name>

Start the VG on any hosts that need to use it:
.br
vgchange \-\-lock\-start <vg_name>


.SS changing a clvm VG to a lockd VG

All LVs must be inactive to change the lock type.

1. Change the clvm VG to a local VG.

Within a running clvm cluster, change a clvm VG to a local VG with the
command:

vgchange \-cn <vg_name>

If the clvm cluster is no longer running on any nodes, then extra options
can be used forcibly make the VG local.  Caution: this is only safe if all
nodes have stopped using the VG:

vgchange \-\-config 'global/locking_type=0 global/use_lvmlockd=0'
.RS
\-cn <vg_name>
.RE

2. After the VG is local, follow the steps described in "changing a local
VG to a lockd VG".


.SS vgremove and vgreduce with sanlock VGs

vgremove of a sanlock VG will fail if other hosts have the VG started.
Run vgchange --lock-stop <vg_name> on all other hosts before vgremove.

(It may take several seconds before vgremove recognizes that all hosts
have stopped.)

A sanlock VG contains a hidden LV called "lvmlock" that holds the sanlock
locks.  vgreduce cannot yet remove the PV holding the lvmlockd LV.


.SS shared LVs

When an LV is used concurrently from multiple hosts (e.g. by a
multi-host/cluster application or file system), the LV can be activated on
multiple hosts concurrently using a shared lock.

To activate the LV with a shared lock:  lvchange -asy vg/lv.

With lvmlockd, an unspecified activation mode is always exclusive, i.e.
-ay defaults to -aey.

If the LV type does not allow the LV to be used concurrently from multiple
hosts, then a shared activation lock is not allowed and the lvchange
command will report an error.  LV types that cannot be used concurrently
from multiple hosts include thin, cache, raid, mirror, and snapshot.

lvextend on LV with shared locks is not yet allowed.  The LV must be
deactivated, or activated exclusively to run lvextend.


.SS recover from lost PV holding sanlock locks

A number of special manual steps must be performed to restore sanlock
locks if the PV holding the locks is lost.  Contact the LVM group for
help with this process.


.\" This is not clean or safe enough to suggest using without help.
.\"
.\" .SS recover from lost PV holding sanlock locks
.\"
.\" In a sanlock VG, the locks are stored on a PV within the VG.  If this PV
.\" is lost, the locks need to be reconstructed as follows:
.\"
.\" 1. Enable the unsafe lock modes option in lvm.conf so that default locking requirements can be overriden.
.\"
.\" .nf
.\" allow_override_lock_modes = 1
.\" .fi
.\"
.\" 2. Remove missing PVs and partial LVs from the VG.
.\"
.\" Warning: this is a dangerous operation.  Read the man page
.\" for vgreduce first, and try running with the test option.
.\" Verify that the only missing PV is the PV holding the sanlock locks.
.\"
.\" .nf
.\" vgreduce --removemissing --force --lock-gl na --lock-vg na <vg>
.\" .fi
.\"
.\" 3. If step 2 does not remove the internal/hidden "lvmlock" lv, it should be removed.
.\"
.\" .nf
.\" lvremove --lock-vg na --lock-lv na <vg>/lvmlock
.\" .fi
.\"
.\" 4. Change the lock type to none.
.\"
.\" .nf
.\" vgchange --lock-type none --force --lock-gl na --lock-vg na <vg>
.\" .fi
.\"
.\" 5. VG space is needed to recreate the locks.  If there is not enough space, vgextend the vg.
.\"
.\" 6. Change the lock type back to sanlock.  This creates a new internal
.\" lvmlock lv, and recreates locks.
.\"
.\" .nf
.\" vgchange --lock-type sanlock <vg>
.\" .fi

.SS locking system failures

.B lvmlockd failure

If lvmlockd fails or is killed while holding locks, the locks are orphaned
in the lock manager.  lvmlockd can be restarted, and it will adopt the
locks from the lock manager that had been held by the previous instance.

.B dlm/corosync failure

If dlm or corosync fail, the clustering system will fence the host using a
method configured within the dlm/corosync clustering environment.

LVM commands on other hosts will be blocked from acquiring any locks until
the dlm/corosync recovery process is complete.

.B sanlock lock storage failure

If access to the device containing the VG's locks is lost, sanlock cannot
renew its leases for locked LVs.  This means that the host could soon lose
the lease to another host which could activate the LV exclusively.
sanlock is designed to never reach the point where two hosts hold the
same lease exclusively at once, so the same LV should never be active on
two hosts at once when activated exclusively.

The current method of handling this involves no action from lvmlockd,
which allows sanlock to protect the leases itself.  This produces a safe
but potentially inconvenient result.  Doing nothing from lvmlockd leads to
the host's LV locks not being released, which leads to sanlock using the
local watchdog to reset the host before another host can acquire any locks
held by the local host.

LVM commands on other hosts will be blocked from acquiring locks held by
the failed/reset host until the sanlock recovery time expires (2-4
minutes).  This includes activation of any LVs that were locked by the
failed host.  It also includes GL/VG locks held by any LVM commands that
happened to be running on the failed host at the time of the failure.

(In the future, lvmlockd may have the option to suspend locked LVs in
response the sanlock leases expiring.  This would avoid the need for
sanlock to reset the host.)

.B sanlock daemon failure

If the sanlock daemon fails or exits while a lockspace is started, the
local watchdog will reset the host.  See previous section for the impact
on other hosts.


.SS changing dlm cluster name

When a dlm VG is created, the cluster name is saved in the VG metadata for
the new VG.  To use the VG, a host must be in the named cluster.  If the
cluster name is changed, or the VG is moved to a different cluster, the
cluster name for the dlm VG must be changed.  To do this:

1. Ensure the VG is not being used by any hosts.

2. The new cluster must be active on the node making the change.
.br
   The current dlm cluster name can be seen by:
.br
   cat /sys/kernel/config/dlm/cluster/cluster_name

3. Change the VG lock type to none:
.br
   vgchange --lock-type none --force <vg_name>

4. Change the VG lock type back to dlm which sets the new cluster name:
.br
   vgchange --lock-type dlm <vg_name>


.SS limitations of lvmlockd and lockd VGs

lvmlockd currently requires using lvmetad and lvmpolld.

If a lockd VG becomes visible after the initial system startup, it is not
automatically started through the system service/init manager, and LVs in
it are not autoactivated.

Things that do not yet work in lockd VGs:
.br
- creating a new thin pool and a new thin LV in a single command
.br
- using lvcreate to create cache pools or cache LVs (use lvconvert)
.br
- using external origins for thin LVs
.br
- splitting mirrors and snapshots from LVs
.br
- vgsplit
.br
- vgmerge
.br
- resizing an LV that is active in the shared mode on multiple hosts


.SS clvmd to lvmlockd transition

(See above for converting an existing clvm VG to a lockd VG.)

While lvmlockd and clvmd are entirely different systems, LVM usage remains
largely the same.  Differences are more notable when using lvmlockd's
sanlock option.

Visible usage differences between lockd VGs with lvmlockd and clvm VGs
with clvmd:

.IP \[bu] 2
lvm.conf must be configured to use either lvmlockd (use_lvmlockd=1) or
clvmd (locking_type=3), but not both.

.IP \[bu] 2
vgcreate --shared creates a lockd VG, and vgcreate --clustered y creates a
clvm VG.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd adds the option of using sanlock for locking, avoiding the
need for network clustering.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd does not require all hosts to see all the same shared devices.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd defaults to the exclusive activation mode whenever the activation
mode is unspecified, i.e. -ay means -aey, not -asy.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd commands always apply to the local host, and never have an effect
on a remote host.  (The activation option 'l' is not used.)

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd works with thin and cache pools and LVs.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd saves the cluster name for a lockd VG using dlm.  Only hosts in
the matching cluster can use the VG.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd requires starting/stopping lockd VGs with vgchange --lock-start
and --lock-stop.

.IP \[bu] 2
vgremove of a sanlock VG may fail indicating that all hosts have not
stopped the lockspace for the VG.  Stop the VG lockspace on all uses using
vgchange --lock-stop.

.IP \[bu] 2
vgreduce of a PV in a sanlock VG may fail if it holds the internal
"lvmlock" LV that holds the sanlock locks.

.IP \[bu] 2
lvmlockd uses lock retries instead of lock queueing, so high lock
contention may require increasing global/lvmlockd_lock_retries to
avoid transient lock contention failures.

.IP \[bu] 2
The reporting options locktype and lockargs can be used to view lockd VG
and LV lock_type and lock_args fields, i.g. vgs -o+locktype,lockargs.
In the sixth VG attr field, "s" for "shared" is displayed for lockd VGs.

.IP \[bu] 2
If lvmlockd fails or is killed while in use, locks it held remain but are
orphaned in the lock manager.  lvmlockd can be restarted with an option to
adopt the orphan locks from the previous instance of lvmlockd.
