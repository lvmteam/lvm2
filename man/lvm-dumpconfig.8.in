.SH DESCRIPTION
lvm dumpconfig produces formatted output with LVM configuration tree.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-file " \fIfilename"
Dump configuration to a file named 'filename'.

.TP
.IR \fB\-\-type " {" current | default | diff | missing | new | profilable }
Select the type of configuration to dump. The configuration settings dumped
have either default values or currently used values assigned based on the
type selected (if no type is selected, \fB\-\-type current\fP is used
by default). Whenever a configuration setting with a default value is
commented out, it means the setting does not have any concrete default
value defined. All output can be saved and reused as proper \fBlvm.conf\fP(5)
file.
.RS
.IP current 3
Dump current \fBlvm.conf\fP configuration merged with any \fBtag config\fP
if used. See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about LVM configuration methods.
.IP default 3
Dump all possible configuration settings with default values assigned.
.IP diff 3
Dump all configuration settings for which the values used differ from defaults.
The value assigned for each configuration setting is the value currently used.
This is actually minimal LVM configuration which can be used without
a change to current configured behaviour.
.IP missing 3
Dump all configuration settings with default values assigned which are
missing in the configuration currently used and for which LVM automatically
fallbacks to using these default values.
.IP new 3
Dump all new configuration settings introduced in current LVM version
or specific version as defined by \fB\-\-atversion\fP option.
.IP profilable 3
Dump all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned.
See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about \fBprofile config\fP method.
.IP profilable-command 3
Dump all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned
that can be used in command profile. This is a subset of settings dumped
by \fB\-\-type \-\-profilable\fP.
.IP profilable-metadata 3
Dump all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned
that can be used in metadata profile. This is a subset of settings dumped
by \fB\-\-type \-\-profilable\fP.
.RE

.TP
.BI \-\-atversion " version"
Specify an LVM version in x.y.z format where x is the major version,
the y is the minor version and z is the patchlevel (e.g. 2.2.106).
When configuration is dumped, the configuration settings recognized
at this LVM version will be considered only. This can be used
to dump a configuration that certain LVM version understands and
which does not contain any newer settings for which LVM would
issue a warning message when checking the configuration.

.TP
.B \-\-ignoreadvanced
Ignore advanced configuration settings on dump.

.TP
.B \-\-ignoreunsupported
Ignore unsupported configuration settings on dump. These settings are
either used for debugging purposes only or their support is not yet
complete and they are not meant to be used in production.

.TP
.BI \-\-config " ConfigurationString"
Use \fBConfigurationString\fP to override existing configuration.
This configuration is then applied for dumpconfig command itself.
See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.BI \-\-commandprofile " ProfileName"
Use \fBProfileName\fP to override existing configuration.
This configuration is then applied for dumpconfig command itself.
See also \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option and \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for
more info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.BI \-\-profile " ProfileName"
The same as using \fB\-\-commandprofile\fP but the configuration is not
applied for dumpconfig command itself.

.TP
.BI \-\-metadataprofile " ProfileName"
Use \fBProfileName\fP to override existing configuration.
The configuration defined in metadata profile has no effect for
dumpconfig command itself, the dumpconfig dumps the configuration only.
See also \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option and \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more
info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-mergedconfig
When the dumpconfig command is run with the \fB\-\-config\fP option
and/or \fB\-\-commandprofile\fP (or using \fBLVM_COMMAND_PROFILE\fP
environment variable), \fB\-\-profile\fP, \fB\-\-metadataprofile\fP
option, merge all the contents of the \fBconfig cascade\fP before dumping it.
Without the \fB\-\-mergeconfig\fP option used, only the configuration at
the front of the cascade is dumped. See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more
info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-validate
Validate current configuration used and exit with appropriate
return code. The validation is done only for the configuration
at the front of the \fBconfig cascade\fP. To validate the whole
merged configuration tree, use also the \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option.
The validation is done even if \fBconfig/checks\fP \fBlvm.conf\fP(5)
option is disabled.

.TP
.B \-\-withcomments
Also dump comments for each configuration node.

.TP
.B \-\-withversions
Also dump a comment containing the version of introduction for
each configuration node.
