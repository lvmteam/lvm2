vgcfgrestore restores the metadata of a VG from a text back up file
produced by \fBvgcfgbackup\fP. This writes VG metadata onto the devices
specified in back up file.
.P
A back up file can be specified with \fB--file\fP.  If no backup file is
specified, the most recent one is used. Use \fB--list\fP for a list of
the available back up and archive files of a VG.
.P
WARNING: When a VG contains thin pools, changes to thin metadata cannot be
reverted, and data loss may occur if thin metadata has changed. The force
option is required to restore in this case.
