.SH DESCRIPTION
pvscan scans all supported LVM block devices in the system for
physical volumes.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP(8) for common options.
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-exported
Only show physical volumes belonging to exported volume groups.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-novolumegroup
Only show physical volumes not belonging to any volume group.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-short
Short listing format.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-uuid
Show UUIDs (Uniform Unique Identifiers) in addition to device special names.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-activate " " \fIay
Together with the information already cached in lvmetad, automatically activate
any logical volumes that become activatable after the scan done on one or more devices.
The logical volume to autoactivate is matched against the
activation/auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf. If this list is not set, then
all volumes are considered for autoactivation. The autoactivation is not yet
supported for logical volumes that are part of partial or clustered volume groups.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-background
Run the command in the background.
.TP
.BR \-\-cache " [" \-\-major " " \fImajor " " \-\-minor " " \fIminor " | " \fIDevicePath " ]..."
Scan one or more devices and instruct the lvmetad daemon to update its cached
state accordingly.  Called internally by udev rules.
All devices listed explicitly are processed \fBregardless\fP of any device
filters set using \fBdevices/filter\fP configuration setting. To filter
devices even in this case, the \fBdevices/global_filter\fP must be used.
