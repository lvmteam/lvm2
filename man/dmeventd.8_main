.SH DESCRIPTION
.
dmeventd is the event monitoring daemon for device-mapper devices.
Library plugins can register and carry out actions triggered when
particular events occur.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B -d
Repeat from 1 to 3 times
.RB ( -d ,
.BR -dd ,
.BR -ddd )
to increase the detail of
debug messages sent to syslog.
Each extra d adds more debugging information.
.
.TP
.B -f
Don't fork, run in the foreground.
.
.TP
.B -h
Show help information.
.
.TP
.B -l
Log through stdout and stderr instead of syslog.
This option works only with option -f, otherwise it is ignored.
.
.TP
.B -?
Show help information on stderr.
.
.TP
.B -R
Replace a running dmeventd instance. The running dmeventd must be version
2.02.77 or newer. The new dmeventd instance will obtain a list of devices and
events to monitor from the currently running daemon.
.
.TP
.B -V
Show version of dmeventd.
.
.SH LVM PLUGINS
.
.TP
.B Mirror
Attempts to handle device failure automatically.
.br
See
.BR lvm.conf (5).
.
.TP
.B Raid
Attempts to handle device failure automatically.
.br
See
.BR lvm.conf (5).
.
.TP
.B Snapshot
Monitors how full a snapshot is becoming and emits a warning to
syslog when it exceeds 80% full.
The warning is repeated when 85%, 90% and 95% of the snapshot is filled.
See
.BR lvm.conf (5).
Snapshot which runs out of space gets invalid and when it is mounted,
it gets umounted if possible.
.
.TP
.B Thin
Monitors how full a thin pool data and metadata is becoming and emits
a warning to syslog when it exceeds 80% full.
The warning is repeated when more then 85%, 90% and 95%
of the thin pool is filled. See
.BR lvm.conf (5).
When a thin pool fills over 50% (data or metadata) thin plugin calls
configured \fBdmeventd/thin_command\fP with every 5% increase.
With default setting it calls internal
\fBlvm lvextend --use-policies\fP to resize thin pool
when it's been filled above configured threshold
\fBactivation/thin_pool_autoextend_threshold\fP.
If the command fails, dmeventd thin plugin will keep
retrying execution with increasing time delay between
retries up to 42 minutes.
User may also configure external command to support more advanced
maintenance operations of a thin pool.
Such external command can e.g. remove some unneeded snapshots,
use \fBfstrim\fP(8) to free recover space in a thin pool,
but also can use \fBlvextend --use-policies\fP if other actions
have not released enough space.
Command is executed with environmental variable
\fBLVM_RUN_BY_DMEVENTD=1\fP so any lvm2 command executed
in this environment will not try to interact with dmeventd.
To see the fullness of a thin pool command may check these
two environmental variables
\fBDMEVENTD_THIN_POOL_DATA\fP and \fBDMEVENTD_THIN_POOL_\:METADATA\fP.
Command can also read status with tools like \fBlvs\fP(8).
.
.TP
.B Vdo
Monitors how full a VDO pool data is becoming and emits
a warning to syslog when it exceeds 80% full.
The warning is repeated when more then 85%, 90% and 95%
of the VDO pool is filled. See
.BR lvm.conf (5).
When a VDO pool fills over 50% vdo plugin calls
configured \fBdmeventd/vdo_command\fP with every 5% increase.
With default setting it calls internal
\fBlvm lvextend --use-policies\fP to resize VDO pool
when it's been filled above the configured threshold
\fBactivation/vdo_pool_autoextend_threshold\fP.
If the command fails, dmeventd vdo plugin will keep
retrying execution with increasing time delay between
retries up to 42 minutes.
User may also configure external command to support more advanced
maintenance operations of a VDO pool.
Such external command can e.g. remove some unneeded space
with \fBfstrim\fP(8),
but also can use \fBlvextend --use-policies\fP if other actions
have not released enough space.
Command is executed with environmental variable
\fBLVM_RUN_BY_DMEVENTD=1\fP so any lvm2 command executed
in this environment will not try to interact with dmeventd.
To see the fullness of a VDO pool command may check this
environmental variable \fBDMEVENTD_VDO_POOL\fP.
Command can also read status with tools like \fBlvs\fP(8).

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.

Variable is set by thin plugin and is available to executed program. Value present
actual usage of thin pool data volume. Variable is not set when error event
is processed.
.TP
.B DMEVENTD_THIN_POOL_METADATA
Variable is set by thin plugin and is available to executed program. Value present
actual usage of thin pool metadata volume. Variable is not set when error event
is processed.

actual usage of VDO pool data volume. Variable is not set when error event
is processed.
.TP
.B LVM_RUN_BY_DMEVENTD
Variable is set by thin and vdo plugin to prohibit recursive iteration
with dmeventd by any executed lvm2 command from
a thin_command, vdo_command environment.
