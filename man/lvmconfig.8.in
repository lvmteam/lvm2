.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmconfig produces formatted output from the LVM configuration tree.
The command was added in release 2.02.119 and has an identical longer form 
\fBlvm dumpconfig\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-file " \fIfilename"
Send output to a file named 'filename'.

.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list
List configuration settings with summarizing comment. This is the same as using
\fBlvmconfig --type list --withsummary\fP.

.TP
.IR \fB\-\-type " {" current | default | diff | missing | new | profilable }
Select the type of configuration to display. The configuration settings
displayed have either default values or currently-used values assigned based on
the type selected. If no type is selected, \fB\-\-type current\fP is used
by default. Whenever a configuration setting with a default value is
commented out, it means the setting does not have any concrete default
value defined. Output can be saved and used as a proper \fBlvm.conf\fP(5)
file.
.RS
.IP current 3
Display the current \fBlvm.conf\fP configuration merged with any \fBtag
config\fP if used. See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about LVM
configuration methods.
.IP default 3
Display all possible configuration settings with default values assigned.
.IP diff 3
Display all configuration settings for which the values used differ from defaults.
The value assigned for each configuration setting is the value currently used.
This is actually minimal LVM configuration which can be used without
a change to current configured behaviour.
.IP list 3
Display plain list of configuration settings.
.IP missing 3
Display all configuration settings with default values assigned which are
missing in the configuration currently used and for which LVM automatically
fallbacks to using these default values.
.IP new 3
Display all new configuration settings introduced in current LVM version
or specific version as defined by \fB\-\-atversion\fP option.
.IP profilable 3
Display all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned.
See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about \fBprofile config\fP method.
.IP profilable-command 3
Display all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned
that can be used in command profile. This is a subset of settings displayed
by \fB\-\-type \-\-profilable\fP.
.IP profilable-metadata 3
Display all profilable configuration settings with default values assigned
that can be used in metadata profile. This is a subset of settings displayed
by \fB\-\-type \-\-profilable\fP.
.RE

.TP
.BI \-\-atversion " version"
Specify an LVM version in x.y.z format where x is the major version,
the y is the minor version and z is the patchlevel (e.g. 2.2.106).
When configuration is displayed, the configuration settings recognized
at this LVM version will be considered only. This can be used
to display a configuration that a certain LVM version understands and
which does not contain any newer settings for which LVM would
issue a warning message when checking the configuration.

.TP
.B \-\-ignoreadvanced
Exclude advanced configuration settings from the output.

.TP
.B \-\-ignoreunsupported
Exclude unsupported configuration settings from the output. These settings are
either used for debugging and development purposes only or their support is not
yet complete and they are not meant to be used in production. The \fBcurrent\fP
and \fBdiff\fP types include unsupported settings in their output by default,
all the other types ignore unsupported settings.

.TP
.B \-\-ignorelocal
Ignore local section.

.TP
.BI \-\-config " ConfigurationString"
Use \fBConfigurationString\fP to override existing configuration.
This configuration is then applied for the lvmconfig command itself.
See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.BI \-\-commandprofile " ProfileName"
Use \fBProfileName\fP to override existing configuration.
This configuration is then applied for the lvmconfig command itself.
See also \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option and \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for
more info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.BI \-\-profile " ProfileName"
The same as using \fB\-\-commandprofile\fP but the configuration is not
applied for the lvmconfig command itself.

.TP
.BI \-\-metadataprofile " ProfileName"
Use \fBProfileName\fP to override existing configuration.
The configuration defined in metadata profile has no effect for
the lvmconfig command itself. lvmconfig displays the configuration only.
See also \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option and \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more
info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-mergedconfig
When the lvmconfig command is run with the \fB\-\-config\fP option
and/or \fB\-\-commandprofile\fP (or using \fBLVM_COMMAND_PROFILE\fP
environment variable), \fB\-\-profile\fP, \fB\-\-metadataprofile\fP
option, merge all the contents of the \fBconfig cascade\fP before displaying it.
Without the \fB\-\-mergeconfig\fP option used, only the configuration at
the front of the cascade is displayed. See also \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more
info about \fBconfig cascade\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-showdeprecated
Include deprecated configuration settings in the output. These settings
are always deprecated since certain version. If concrete version is specified
with \fB--atversion\fP option, deprecated settings are automatically included
if specified version is lower that the version in which the settings were
deprecated. The \fBcurrent\fP and \fBdiff\fP types include deprecated settings
int their output by default, all the other types ignore deprecated settings.

.TP
.B \-\-showunsupported
Include unsupported configuration settings in the output. These settings
are either used for debugging or development purposes only or their support
is not yet complete and they are not meant to be used in production. The
\fBcurrent\fP and \fBdiff\fP types include unsupported settings in their
output by default, all the other types ignore unsupported settings.

.TP
.B \-\-validate
Validate current configuration used and exit with appropriate
return code. The validation is done only for the configuration
at the front of the \fBconfig cascade\fP. To validate the whole
merged configuration tree, use also the \fB\-\-mergedconfig\fP option.
The validation is done even if \fBconfig/checks\fP \fBlvm.conf\fP(5)
option is disabled.

.TP
.B \-\-withsummary
Display a one line comment for each configuration node.

.TP
.B \-\-withcomments
Display a full comment for each configuration node. For deprecated
settings, also display comments about deprecation in addition.

.TP
.B \-\-withversions
Also display a comment containing the version of introduction for
each configuration node. If the setting is deprecated, also display
the version since which it is deprecated.
