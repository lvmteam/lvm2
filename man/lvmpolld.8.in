.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmpolld is polling daemon for LVM. The daemon receives requests for polling
of already initialised operations originating in LVM2 command line tool.
The requests for polling originates in \fBlvconvert\fP, \fBpvmove\fP,
\fBlvchange\fP or \fBvgchange\fP LVM2 command.

The purpose of lvmpolld is to reduce the number of spawned background processes
per otherwise unique polling operation. There should be only one. It also eliminates
the possibility of unsolicited termination of background process by external factors.

lvmpolld is used by LVM only if it is enabled in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) by specifying the
\fBglobal/use_lvmpolld\fP setting. If this is not defined in the LVM configuration
explicitly then default setting is used instead (see the output of
\fBlvmconfig \-\-type default global/use_lvmpolld\fP command).
.SH OPTIONS

To run the daemon in a test environment both the pidfile_path and the
socket_path should be changed from the defaults.
.TP
.B \-f
Don't fork, but run in the foreground.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-?
Show help information.
.TP
.IR \fB\-l " {" all | wire | debug }
Select the type of log messages to generate.
Messages are logged by syslog.
Additionally, when \-f is given they are also sent to standard error.
There are two classes of messages: wire and debug. Selecting 'all' supplies both
and is equivalent to a comma-separated list \-l wire,debug.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpidfile_path
Path to the pidfile. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_PID_DIR#/lvmpolld.pid) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE\fP.  This file is used to prevent more
than one instance of the daemon running simultaneously.
.TP
.B \-s \fIsocket_path
Path to the socket file. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_RUN_DIR#/lvmpolld.socket) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET\fP.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout_value
When runs as native systemd service daemon may shutdown after being
idle for the given time (in seconds). When the option is omitted or
the value given is zero the daemon never shutdowns on idle. When
the daemon doesn't run as native systemd service the timeout is
ignored and never shutdowns on idle.
.TP
.B \-B \fIlvm_binary_path
Optional path to alternative LVM binary (default: #LVM_PATH#). Use for
testing purposes only.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version of lvmpolld daemon.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE
Path for the pid file.
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET
Path for the socket file.
