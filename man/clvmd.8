.SH NAME
clvmd \- cluster LVM daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clvmd
[\-d] [\-h]
[\-R]
[\-t <timeout>]
[\-V]
.SH DESCRIPTION
clvmd is the daemon that distributes LVM metadata updates around a cluster.
It must be running on all nodes in the cluster and will give an error 
if a node in the cluster does not have this daemon running.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-d
Runs in the foreground and prints debugging information (if compiled in) to
stderr. By default, clvmd will fork into the background when invoked.
.TP
.I \-t <timeout>
Specifies the timeout for commands to run around the cluster. This should not
be so small that commands with many disk updates to do will fail, so you
may need to increase this on systems with very large disk farms. 
The default is 30 seconds.
.TP
.I \-R
Tells all the running clvmd in the cluster to reload their device cache and
re-read the lvm configuration file. This command should be run whenever the
devices on a cluster system are changed.
.TP
.I \-V
Display the version of the cluster LVM daemon.
