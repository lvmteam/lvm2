lvmvdo \(em Support for Virtual Data Optimizer in LVM
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
VDO is software that provides inline
block-level deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning capabilities
for primary storage.
.P
Deduplication is a technique for reducing the consumption of storage
resources by eliminating multiple copies of duplicate blocks. Compression
takes the individual unique blocks and shrinks them.
These reduced blocks are then efficiently packed together into
physical blocks. Thin provisioning manages the mapping from logical blocks
presented by VDO to where the data has actually been physically stored,
and also eliminates any blocks of all zeroes.
.P
With deduplication, instead of writing the same data more than once, VDO detects and records each
duplicate block as a reference to the original
block. VDO maintains a mapping from Logical Block Addresses (LBA) (used by the
storage layer above VDO) to physical block addresses (used by the storage
layer under VDO). After deduplication, multiple logical block addresses
may be mapped to the same physical block address; these are called shared
blocks and are reference-counted by the software.
.P
With compression, VDO compresses multiple blocks (or shared blocks)
with the fast LZ4 algorithm, and bins them together where possible so that
multiple compressed blocks fit within a 4 KB block on the underlying
storage. Mapping from LBA is to a physical block address and index within
it for the desired compressed data. All compressed blocks are individually
reference counted for correctness.
.P
Block sharing and block compression are invisible to applications using
the storage, which read and write blocks as they would if VDO were not
present. When a shared block is overwritten, a new physical block is
allocated for storing the new block data to ensure that other logical
block addresses that are mapped to the shared physical block are not
modified.
.P
To use VDO with \fBlvm\fP(8), you must install the standard VDO user-space tools
\fBvdoformat\fP(8) and the currently non-standard kernel VDO module
"\fIkvdo\fP".
.P
The "\fIkvdo\fP" module implements fine-grained storage virtualization,
thin provisioning, block sharing, and compression.
The "\fIuds\fP" module provides memory-efficient duplicate
identification. The user-space tools include \fBvdostats\fP(8)
for extracting statistics from VDO volumes.

.
.SH VDO USAGE
.
The primary methods for using VDO with lvm2:
.nr step 1 1
.
.SS \n[step]. Create a VDOPoolLV and a VDOLV
.
Create a VDOPoolLV that will hold VDO data, and a
virtual size VDOLV that the user can use. If you do not specify the virtual size,
then the VDOLV is created with the maximum size that
always fits into data volume even if no
deduplication or compression can happen
(i.e. it can hold the incompressible content of /dev/urandom).
If you do not specify the name of VDOPoolLV, it is taken from
the sequence of vpool0, vpool1 ...
.P
Note: The performance of TRIM/Discard operations is slow for large
volumes of VDO type. Please try to avoid sending discard requests unless
necessary because it might take considerable amount of time to finish the discard
operation.
.P
.nf
.B lvcreate --type vdo -n VDOLV -L DataSize -V LargeVirtualSize VG/VDOPoolLV
.B lvcreate --vdo -L DataSize VG
.fi
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type vdo -n vdo0 -L 10G -V 100G vg/vdopool0
# mkfs.ext4 -E nodiscard /dev/vg/vdo0
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Convert an existing LV into VDOPoolLV
.
Convert an already created or existing LV into a VDOPoolLV, which is a volume
that can hold data and metadata.
You will be prompted to confirm such conversion because it \fBIRREVERSIBLY
DESTROYS\fP the content of such volume and the volume is immediately
formatted by \fBvdoformat\fP(8) as a VDO pool data volume. You can
specify the virtual size of the VDOLV associated with this VDOPoolLV.
If you do not specify the virtual size, it will be set to the maximum size
that can keep 100% incompressible data there.
.P
.nf
.B lvconvert --type vdo-pool -n VDOLV -V VirtualSize VG/VDOPoolLV
.B lvconvert --vdopool VG/VDOPoolLV
.fi
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvconvert --type vdo-pool -n vdo0 -V10G vg/ExistingLV
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Change the compression and deduplication of a VDOPoolLV
.
Disable or enable the compression and deduplication for VDOPoolLV
(the volume that maintains all VDO LV(s) associated with it).
.P
.B lvchange --compression y|n --deduplication y|n VG/VDOPoolLV
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvchange --compression n  vg/vdopool0
# lvchange --deduplication y vg/vdopool1
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Change the default settings used for creating a VDOPoolLV
.
VDO allows to set a large variety of options. Lots of these settings
can be specified in lvm.conf or profile settings. You can prepare
a number of different profiles in the \fI#DEFAULT_SYS_DIR#/profile\fP directory
and just specify the profile file name.
Check the output of \fBlvmconfig --type default --withcomments\fP
for a detailed description of all individual VDO settings.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# cat <<EOF > #DEFAULT_SYS_DIR#/profile/vdo_create.profile
allocation {
.RS
vdo_use_compression=1
vdo_use_deduplication=1
vdo_use_metadata_hints=1
vdo_minimum_io_size=4096
vdo_block_map_cache_size_mb=128
vdo_block_map_period=16380
vdo_use_sparse_index=0
vdo_index_memory_size_mb=256
vdo_slab_size_mb=2048
vdo_ack_threads=1
vdo_bio_threads=1
vdo_bio_rotation=64
vdo_cpu_threads=2
vdo_hash_zone_threads=1
vdo_logical_threads=1
vdo_physical_threads=1
vdo_write_policy="auto"
vdo_max_discard=1
.RE
}
EOF
.P
# lvcreate --vdo -L10G --metadataprofile vdo_create vg/vdopool0
# lvcreate --vdo -L10G --config 'allocation/vdo_cpu_threads=4' vg/vdopool1
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Set or change VDO settings with option --vdosettings
.
Use the form 'option=value' or 'option1=value option2=value',
or repeat --vdosettings for each option being set.
Options are listed in the Example section above, for the full description see
.BR lvm.conf (5).
Options can omit 'vdo_' and 'vdo_use_' prefixes and all its underscores.
So i.e.  vdo_use_metadata_hints=1  and  metadatahints=1 are equivalent.
To change the option for an already existing VDOPoolLV use
.BR lvchange (8)
command. However not all option can be changed.
Only compression and deduplication options can be also changed for an active VDO LV.
Lowest priority options are specified with configuration file,
then with --vdosettings and highest are expliction option --compression
and --deduplication.
.P
.I Example
.P
.nf
# lvcreate --vdo -L10G --vdosettings 'ack_threads=1 hash_zone_threads=2' vg/vdopool0
# lvchange --vdosettings 'bio_threads=2 deduplication=1' vg/vdopool0
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Checking the usage of VDOPoolLV
.
To quickly check how much data on a VDOPoolLV is already consumed,
use \fBlvs\fP(8). The Data% field reports how much data is occupied
in the content of the virtual data for the VDOLV and how much space is already
consumed with all the data and metadata blocks in the VDOPoolLV.
For a detailed description, use the \fBvdostats\fP(8) command.
.P
Note: \fBvdostats\fP(8) currently understands only \fI/dev/mapper\fP device names.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type vdo -L10G -V20G -n vdo0 vg/vdopool0
# mkfs.ext4 -E nodiscard /dev/vg/vdo0
# lvs -a vg

.
.SS \n+[step]. Extending the VDOPoolLV size
.
You can add more space to hold VDO data and metadata by
extending the VDODataLV using the commands
\fBlvresize\fP(8) and \fBlvextend\fP(8).
The extension needs to add at least one new VDO slab. You can configure
the slab size with the \fB\%allocation/\:vdo_slab_size_mb\fP setting.
.P
You can also enable automatic size extension of a monitored VDOPoolLV
with the \fBactivation/vdo_pool_autoextend_percent\fP and
\fB\%activation/\:vdo_pool_autoextend_threshold\fP settings.
.P
Note: You cannot reduce the size of a VDOPoolLV.
.P
.B lvextend -L+AddingSize VG/VDOPoolLV
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvextend -L+50G vg/vdopool0
# lvresize -L300G vg/vdopool1
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Extending or reducing the VDOLV size
.
You can extend or reduce a virtual VDO LV as a standard LV with the
\fBlvresize\fP(8), \fBlvextend\fP(8), and \fBlvreduce\fP(8) commands.
.P
Note: The reduction needs to process TRIM for reduced disk area
to unmap used data blocks from the VDOPoolLV, which might take
a long time.
.P
.B lvextend -L+AddingSize VG/VDOLV
.br
.B lvreduce -L-ReducingSize VG/VDOLV
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvextend -L+50G vg/vdo0
# lvreduce -L-50G vg/vdo1
# lvresize -L200G vg/vdo2
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Component activation of a VDODataLV
.
You can activate a VDODataLV separately as a component LV for examination
purposes. The activation of the VDODataLV activates the data LV in read-only mode,
and the data LV cannot be modified.
If the VDODataLV is active as a component, any upper LV using this volume CANNOT
be activated. You have to deactivate the VDODataLV first to continue to use the VDOPoolLV.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvchange -ay vg/vpool0_vdata
# lvchange -an vg/vpool0_vdata
.fi
.
.SH VDO TOPICS
.
.nr step 1 1
.
.SS \n[step]. Stacking VDO
.
You can convert or stack a VDOPooLV with these currently supported
volume types: linear, stripe, raid and cache with cachepool.
.
.SS \n[step]. Using multiple volumes using same VDOPoolLV
.
You can convert existing VDO LV into a thin volume. After this conversion
you can create a thin snapshot or you can add more thin volumes
with thin-pool named after orignal LV name LV_tpool0.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type vdo -L 5G -V 10G -n vdo1 vg/vdopool
# lvconvert --type thin vg/vdo1
# lvcreate -V20 vg/vdo1_tpool0
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. VDOPoolLV on top of raid
.
Using a raid type LV for a VDODataLV.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type raid1 -L 5G -n vdopool vg
# lvconvert --type vdo-pool -V 10G vg/vdopool
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Caching a VDOPoolLV
.
VDOPoolLV (accepts also VDODataLV volume name) caching provides a mechanism
to accelerate reads and writes of already compressed and deduplicated
data blocks together with VDO metadata.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type vdo -L 5G -V 10G -n vdo1 vg/vdopool
# lvcreate --type cache-pool -L 1G -n cachepool vg
# lvconvert --cache --cachepool vg/cachepool vg/vdopool
# lvconvert --uncache vg/vdopool
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Caching a VDOLV
.
VDO LV cache allow you to 'cache' a device for better performance before
it hits the processing of the VDO Pool LV layer.
.P
.I Example
.nf
# lvcreate --type vdo -L 5G -V 10G -n vdo1 vg/vdopool
# lvcreate --type cache-pool -L 1G -n cachepool vg
# lvconvert --cache --cachepool vg/cachepool vg/vdo1
# lvconvert --uncache vg/vdo1
.fi
.
.SS \n+[step]. Usage of Discard/TRIM with a VDOLV
.
You can discard data on a VDO LV and reduce used blocks on a VDOPoolLV.
However, the current performance of discard operations is still not optimal
and takes a considerable amount of time and CPU.
Unless you really need it, you should avoid using discard.
.P
When a block device is going to be rewritten,
its blocks will be automatically reused for new data.
Discard is useful in situations when user knows that the given portion of a VDO LV
is not going to be used and the discarded space can be used for block
provisioning in other regions of the VDO LV.
For the same reason, you should avoid using mkfs with discard for
a freshly created VDO LV to save a lot of time that this operation would
take otherwise as device is already expected to be empty.
.
.SS \n+[step]. Memory usage
.
The VDO target requires 38 MiB of RAM and several variable amounts:
.IP \(bu 2
1.15 MiB of RAM for each 1 MiB of configured block map cache size.
The block map cache requires a minimum of 150 MiB RAM.
.br
.IP \(bu
1.6 MiB of RAM for each 1 TiB of logical space.
.br
.IP \(bu
268 MiB of RAM for each 1 TiB of physical storage managed by the volume.
.br
.P
UDS requires a minimum of 250 MiB of RAM,
which is also the default amount that deduplication uses.
.P
The memory required for the UDS index is determined by the index type
and the required size of the deduplication window and
is controlled by the \fBallocation/vdo_use_sparse_index\fP setting.
.P
With enabled UDS sparse indexing, it relies on the temporal locality of data
and attempts to retain only the most relevant index entries in memory and
can maintain a deduplication window that is ten times larger
than with dense while using the same amount of memory.
.P
Although the sparse index provides the greatest coverage,
the dense index provides more deduplication advice.
For most workloads, given the same amount of memory,
the difference in deduplication rates between dense
and sparse indexes is negligible.
.P
A dense index with 1 GiB of RAM maintains a 1 TiB deduplication window,
while a sparse index with 1 GiB of RAM maintains a 10 TiB deduplication window.
In general, 1 GiB is sufficient for 4 TiB of physical space with
a dense index and 40 TiB with a sparse index.
.
.SS \n+[step]. Storage space requirements
.
You can configure a VDOPoolLV to use up to 256 TiB of physical storage.
Only a certain part of the physical storage is usable to store data.
This section provides the calculations to determine the usable size
of a VDO-managed volume.
.P
The VDO target requires storage for two types of VDO metadata and for the UDS index:
.IP \(bu 2
The first type of VDO metadata uses approximately 1 MiB for each 4 GiB
of physical storage plus an additional 1 MiB per slab.
.IP \(bu
The second type of VDO metadata consumes approximately 1.25 MiB
for each 1 GiB of logical storage, rounded up to the nearest slab.
.IP \(bu
The amount of storage required for the UDS index depends on the type of index
and the amount of RAM allocated to the index. For each 1 GiB of RAM,
a dense UDS index uses 17 GiB of storage and a sparse UDS index will use
170 GiB of storage.
