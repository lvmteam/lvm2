.SH NAME
cmirrord \- cluster mirror log daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cmirrord

.SH DESCRIPTION
cmirrord is the daemon that tracks mirror log information in a cluster.
It is specific to device-mapper based mirrors (and by extension, LVM
cluster mirrors).  Cluster mirrors are not possible without this daemon
running.

This daemon relies on the cluster infrastructure provided by the
Cluster MANager (CMAN), which must be set up and running in order for
cmirrord to function.  (The cluster infrastructure is also required for
clvmd.)

Output is logged via syslog.  The USR1 signal can be issued to cmirrord
to gather current status information for debugging purposes.

Once started, cmirrord will run until it is shutdown via INT signal.  If
there are still active cluster mirrors, however, the signal will be
ignored.  Active cluster mirrors should be shutdown before stopping the
cluster mirror log daemon.
