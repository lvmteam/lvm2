Other Changes
-------------

* Support `--setpersist` in vgcreate.
* Use only hostid-based PR keys for sanlock VGs.
* Update lvmlockd(8) man page.
* Consistent sorting of command options in help and man pages.
* Use `-real` UUID suffix to keep internal volumes hidden from udev. This is
  implemented for RAID, mirror, integrity, and internal pvmove volumes. This
  should handle corner cases where where operations were not finishing cleanly.
* Fix adding and removing integrity to RAID volumes.
* Deactivate internal lvmlock LV if lock start fails.
* Detect insufficient space for RAID with split metadata.
