# Udev rules for device-mapper devices.
#
# These rules set permissions for DM devices.
#
# This file is considered to be a template where users can put their
# own entries and then put a copy of it manually to a usual place with
# user-edited udev rules (usually /etc/udev/rules.d).
#
# There are some environment variables set that can be used:
#   DM_UDEV_RULES_VSN - DM udev rules version
#   DM_NAME - actual DM device's name
#   DM_UUID - UUID set for DM device (blank if not specified)
#   DM_SUSPENDED - suspended state of DM device (0 or 1)
#   DM_LV_NAME - logical volume name (not set if LVM device not present)
#   DM_VG_NAME - volume group name (not set if LVM device not present)
#   DM_LV_LAYER - logical volume layer (not set if LVM device not present)
